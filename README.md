Rusted NIO
============

An early attempt at a high performance non-blocking io library for rust. This is still in an extremely early stage, and
    is not ready for use in any way shape or form.

Long term the library take some inspiration from Netty, a Java non-blocking io library.

Contributing
===========
I am currently experimenting with this library, and am not yet looking for contributors.
